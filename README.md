# Chapter 6: Containerization and Reproducibility

This chapter demonstrates how to package, track, and deploy machine learning workflows with Docker and MLflow — ensuring full reproducibility and portability across environments.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a containerized pipeline that tracks ML experiments, models, and metrics using MLflow, all isolated within a Docker environment.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Docker basics for ML reproducibility
- MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
- Best practices for containerizing training and inference
- How to avoid the dreaded "it worked on my machine" trap

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.9
- Docker
- MLflow
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
